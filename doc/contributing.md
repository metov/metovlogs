# Contribution guidelines
There aren't really any rules at this point, but a few guidelines are:

* If something isn't working, you have an idea for improvements or just a question, feel free to open an issue
* Since the project doesn't get much traffic, I may initially take a week or two to respond -- please be patient
* The recommended way to propose changes is to fork the repo and submit a pull request
* Summarize your change in the PR title (use general git commit message best practices: <60 chars, imperative, succinct but start with a capital)
* If it doesn't fit in the title, feel free to add details in the PR description
* If the change is non-trivial, feel free to explain your rationale and provide evidence that your change works in the PR description
* I am available for mentoring. If you are confused about the project, or you're a novice programmer, please open an issue and we can figure out how I can help
