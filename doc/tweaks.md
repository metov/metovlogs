# Tweaking metovlogs
## `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable
You can change the level of logs shown by metovlogs by setting an environment variable:
```
export LOG_LEVEL=INFO
```

And the logs will now be at info level. For a full list of levels, see the `coloredlogs` [documentation](https://coloredlogs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#coloredlogs.find_defined_levels).
